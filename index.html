                  My first experience playing video games was at a local arcade in South Philly back in the early 80's.
                
                  I played the classics, like Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Centipede, Space Invaders, Frogger, Ms. Pac-Man, Asteroids, etc.

                  Soon after, we got an Atari 2600. I played Pole Position, Pitfall!, Joust, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, and more. Then came the Atari 5200 and Intellivision. Then, Nintendo and Sega Genesis. Eventually, Playstation.

                After that, life changed and I found myself having to get a job and live on my own.

                  Eventually I got married, bought a house, and had kids. I purchased an Xbox 360, then a Wii U and a PS4 and had fun playing with my kids.

                I started watching YouTube videos, and I noticed people uploading videos of them playing video games. Not only that, but they were showing tips and tricks to help people beat the games.

               <p>
               This gave me the idea of doing the same thing. I ended up getting a laptop and some other equipment, like an Elgato capture card to record the gameplay from the consoles, and a video camera and microphone.

               My first attempts at recording and editing the videos went fairly well, but I maid the mistake of leaving in copyrighted music and cutscenes. So, some of my videos were getting copyright warnings. 
               <br><br>
               I learned how to get better by experimenting with a few different channels. As time went on, I took a break from it because life happened again.

                  Eventually, I got inspired again and I created Joel Jumps on February 20, 2022 <span>&#128515;</span>
                  <br><br>
                  I didn't actually start uploading videos until later that year - around September or October 2022.

                  I wanted my gaming channel to be family friendly, so I decided to focus mostly on playing non-violent platformer games like Sonic. I also play Roblox "Find The..." style games, as well as indie games like Planet of Lana.
